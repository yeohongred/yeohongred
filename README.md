git commit -m “Make (my) life easier with code”

-m “Hi! My name is Yeo Hong and I like making (my) life easier with code. As someone who is always looking for something new to do and hates monotony, I thrive on automating repetitive tasks to reduce friction and streamline workflows in both personal and professional settings. Driven by this mindset, I am constantly learning various languages and frameworks to optimise productivity, convenience, and overall quality of life. Being somewhat of a perfectionist, my tendency to focus heavily on the smallest of details is what motivates me to take action and actualise the changes I wish to see. I am excited to keep leveraging technology to create more efficient solutions and contribute to innovative, impactful projects!”
